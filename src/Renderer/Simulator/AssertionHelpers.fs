//TODO put here helpers for AST checking and evalutaion 

// checking function will be called upon creation of a component and either store the AST in a data structure to be defined or an error message list to be desplayed 

// evaluation function will be called when a simulation is performed 

// for now there is support for 
// - wave simulation 
// - sheets with only components in that sheet (as the AST datastructure might be per sheet for now)
